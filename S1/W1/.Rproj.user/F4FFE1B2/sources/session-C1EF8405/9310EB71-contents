## 1 Melbourne house prices regression model
### 1.1 Load the data
##### Load the Melbourne house price dataset from Canvas.
```{r}
mel = read.csv("Melbourne_housing_FULL.csv")
```

### 1.2
##### We will need to subset the data to only look at 3 suburbs - Brunswick, Craigieburn and Hawthorn. Similar to lab 1, start the data analysis by generating some quantitative and graphical summaries. For example, determine the average price in each of these three suburbs. Explore more summaries of the data.

##### For the following questions, use the subsetted data for the Suburbs of Brunswick, Craigieburn and Hawthorn.

```{r}
Br = mel[mel$Suburb == "Brunswick", ]
summary(Br)
```

```{r}
Cr = mel[mel$Suburb == "Craigieburn", ]
summary(Cr)
```

```{r}
Ha = mel[mel$Suburb == "Hawthorn", ]
summary(Ha)
```
The average price in each of Brunswick, Craigieburn and Hawthorn are 977989, 566174, 1238074.

### 1.3
##### To examine the association between house prices and a single variable, start by constructing a simple linear regression using only BuildingArea as a predictor. Use an appropriate statistic to justify the goodness of fit of the prediction and create a graphical output to enable you to assess your model fit.
```{r}
melsub <- subset(mel, Suburb == "Hawthorn" | Suburb == "Brunswick" | Suburb == "Craigieburn")

lm1 = lm(Price ~ BuildingArea, data = melsub)
summary(lm1)
```
```{r}
plot(melsub$BuildingArea, melsub$Price, xlab = "Building Area", ylab = "Price", main = "Mel house regression")
abline(lm1,col="blue")
```

The $R^2$ is 17%.

```{r}
plot(lm1)
```


### 1.4a
##### Variability of house prices are complex and likely to be explained by many different factors. Construct a multiple linear regression here by examining if adding Suburb as a predictor will improve the prediction? Notice that Suburb is a categorical variable. Briefly describe how to interpret the regression coefficients returned by lm.
```{r cars}
lm2 = lm(Price ~ BuildingArea + Suburb, data = melsub)
summary(lm2)
```
Both $R^2$ and adjusted $R^2$ are improved. $R^2$ is improved from 17% to 42.5%, and adjusted $R^2$ increases form 17% to 42%. 
Brunswick is the default, Craigieburn's intercept involves subtracting 6660277.3, and Hawthorn's intercpet is by adding 400715.9 .  
Craigieburn properties are $660277.3 cheapter than properties in Brunswick, on average, while hodling BuidlingArea stable. 
Craigieburn properties are $400715.9 more expensive than properties in Brunswick, on average, while hodling BuidlingArea stable.

```{r}
plot(lm2)
```
There appears to exist potentially outliers but present better than without adding Suburb. 

### 1.4b
##### There are many other variables in the data, consider whether adding the number of car spaces as a predictor improves the prediction model?

```{r}
lm3 = lm(Price ~ BuildingArea + Suburb + Car, data = melsub)
summary(lm3)
```
Both $R^2$ and adjusted $R^2$ are improved after adding the number of car spaces as a predictor. $R^2$ is improved from 42.5% to 47.7%, and adjusted $R^2$ increases form 42% to 47.18%. 

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(lm3)
```
