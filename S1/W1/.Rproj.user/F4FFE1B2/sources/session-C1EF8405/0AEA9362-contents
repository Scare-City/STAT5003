#1.3
To examine the association between house prices and a single variable, start by constructing a simple linear regression using only BuildingArea as a predictor. Use an appropriate statistic to justify the goodness of fit of the prediction and create a graphical output to enable you to assess your model fit.
```{r}
lm1 = lm(Price ~ BuildingArea, data = melsub)
summary(lm1)
```
```{r}
plot(melsub$BuildingArea, melsub$Price, xlab = "Building Area", ylab = "Price", main = "Mel house regression")
abline(lm1,col="blue")
```
The $R^2$ is 17%.
```{r}
plot(lm1)
```


#1.4a
Variability of house prices are complex and likely to be explained by many different factors. Construct a multiple linear regression here by examining if adding Suburb as a predictor will improve the prediction? Notice that Suburb is a categorical variable. Briefly describe how to interpret the regression coefficients returned by lm.
```{r cars}
lm2 = lm(Price ~ BuildingArea + Suburb, data = melsub)
summary(lm2)
```
Both $R^2$ and adjusted $R^2$ are improved. $R^2$ is improved from 17% to 42.5%, and adjusted $R^2$ increases form 17% to 42%. 
Brunswick is the default, Craigieburn's intercept involves subtracting 6660277.3, and Hawthorn's intercpet is by adding 400715.9 .  
Craigieburn properties are $660277.3 cheapter than properties in Brunswick, on average, while hodling BuidlingArea stable. 
Craigieburn properties are $400715.9 more expensive than properties in Brunswick, on average, while hodling BuidlingArea stable.

```{r}
plot(lm2)
```
There appears to exist potentially outliers but present better than without adding Suburb. 

#1.4b
There are many other variables in the data, consider whether adding the number of car spaces as a predictor improves the prediction model?

```{r}
lm3 = lm(Price ~ BuildingArea + Suburb + Car, data = melsub)
summary(lm3)
```
Both $R^2$ and adjusted $R^2$ are improved after adding the number of car spaces as a predictor. $R^2$ is improved from 42.5% to 47.7%, and adjusted $R^2$ increases form 42% to 47.18%. 

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(lm3)
```
