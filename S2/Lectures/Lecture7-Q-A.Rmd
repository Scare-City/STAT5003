> Examples given for MAR and MNAR seem to me like they are the same thing. 
What is the difference?

* Suppose the survey asked questions with the following variables

| Age | Salary      | SES |
|:----|:------------|:----|
| 16  | 100000      | 1   |
| NA  | 100000      | 1   |
| 16  | 100 (NA)    | 5   |
| 55  | 100000      | 1   |
| 55  | 1000000(NA) | 1   |

* Example 1: _E.g. Let’s say we run a survey and some people don’t want to give their age in the questionnaire, but this does not relate to any other variable (including their party preference)_
    - The age $(Y)$ is the variable with missing data. The missingness of age doesn't depend on any other covariate. Some people just dont want to reveal their age. (Missing value of $Y$ doesn't depend on anything)
    _ Verbally mentioned a missing completely at random survey style
        - There is another missing value technique to deal with this using available data
        - E.g. Can compute pairwise correlations to do a multiple regression model.

* Example 2: _In a survey, if people from a lower socioeconomic status may be less willing to provide salary information (but we know their SES status)._
    - The salary $(Y)$ is the variable with missing data. The missingness of salary depends on the SES variable.

> Some slides are missing images in the lecture PDF file. 
Is that an html exporting error? This occurs in previous weeks too. 

* Yes it is. I was hoping to keep everything in HTML
    - Feedback welcome on how to fix this.

> Does this have to be random imputation?

> Why is the meaning of: "the uncertainty in the missing value data is lost"?

* The comment there was referring to imputing missing data with a deterministic value.
* However, statistical methods try and model uncertainty in sampled values.
* Consider the extreme case.
* You believe population comes from bell curve
* Some are missing. You decide to replace the missing values with the mean.

> What is a dummy variable?

I think I may have used it in the lecture to describe that I was keeping track of which variable has been set to missing and which is not missing.

* Dummy variables are indicator or binary variables (either 0 or 1)
    - In the binary case, a zero would denote the variable doesn't have the condition and 1 denotes the variable does have the condition.
    - E.g. in regression you might want to include information on gender (or age etc)
    - The model might be $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2X_2 + \varepsilon$

> Can you explain a little bit more the Cohen's Kappa metric? Can you provide an example?

\[
    \kappa = \frac{p_o - p_e}{1 - p_e} = 1 - \frac{1 - p_o}{1 - p_e}
\]

* $p_o =$ observed agreement of classes = Overall Accuracy
* $p_e =$ hypothetical expected agreement 

Consider the simple case of binary classification (two classes) with $n$ cases
Call the two judges, judges $A$ and $B$.

* Judge $A$ could denote the observed class assignment labels. 
* Judge $B$ could denote the predicted class assignment labels

\[
    p_o = \text{Proportion of Agreement between judge $A$ and $B$} = \text{This is the accuracy.}
\]

The other metric $p_e$ is the empirical chance these judges give the classification by chance.

\begin{align*}
    p_e &= P(\text{Judge $A$ and Judge $B$ agree on a randomly picked element})\\
        &= P(\text{Judge $A$ and Judge $B$ classify 1 or Judge $A$ and Judge $B$ classify 0})\\
        &= P(\text{Judge $A$ and Judge $B$ classify 1}) + P(\text{Judge $A$ and Judge $B$ classify 0})\\
        &= P(\text{Judge $A$ classify 1})P(\text{Judge $B$ classify 1}) + P(\text{Judge $A$ classify 0}) P(\text{Judge $B$ classify 0})
\end{align*}

```{r }
library(caret)
n <- 1e6; perc <- 98;
obs <- factor(rep(c(0, 1),  c(perc/100 * n, (100 - perc)/100 * n)))
m <- 0
pred <- factor(rep(c(0, 1), c(n - m, m)), levels = c(0, 1))
confusionMatrix(obs, pred)
cM <- xtabs(~obs+pred)
cM
```
